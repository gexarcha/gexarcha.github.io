# Biography

I did my undergraduate studies in the Mathematics department of Aristotle Univesity of Thessaloniki. After that I joined the M.Sc. program in Computational Science at the Department for Theoretical Physics of Frankfurt University with a specialization on Machine Learning and Computation Neuroscience. My doctoral research was supporte in collaboration  between Prof. Roland Memisevic at the University of Frankfurt (2012-2013), Prof. Bruno Olshausen at the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at UC Berekely (2013-2014), and Prof. Jörg Lücke at the University of Oldenburg(2014-2016). As a result, I was awared the degree of Dr. rer. nat. for the university of Oldenburg on 01.11.2016.  Currently, I work as postdoctoral research at Prof. Stephane Mallat's DATA team at École Normale Supérieure.

My research interests revolve around sparse coding, graphical models, deep learning, and theoretical neuroscience. I have studied their applications primarily on spike sorting, receptive field estimation, quantum chemistry, and natural image statistics.
